# VGASquares


It is an example of how to use the a FPGA and VGA monitor. This example shows three litlle square of different colors.
The little squares are shifting to different positions in the screen, when they touch a screen border change of shifting address.

It has been used Verilog as programing language. The vga.v descrive the VGA interface, this piece of code is from the book "Programming FPGA: Getting started with Verilog". The prescalar.v's piece of code is from Obijuan "https://github.com/Obijuan/open-fpga-verilog-tutorial/wiki" which has  really recomended tutorial in spanish. The square.v described the behaviour of the squares 


The using FPGA's model has been Spartan 6.
